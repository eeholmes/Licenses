Info on licenses for US gov public domain work

"Software developed by US federal government employees as part of their official duties is not subject to copyright protection and is considered “public domain” (see 17 USC § 105). Public domain software can be used by anyone for any purpose, and cannot be released under a copyright license (including typical open source software licenses)."

- Department of Defense FAQ but not very helpful since it says gov works must be released as public domain and then goes on to only talk about OSS licenses, which cannot be used for public domain . https://dodcio.defense.gov/open-source-software-faq/#Releasing_software_as_OSS
